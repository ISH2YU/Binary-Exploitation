Cant overwrite GOT if full Relro

1st prinf to leak the canary then we use the 2nd gets() call to overflow the buffer making sure we overwirte the canary with the correct value, goal is return to win
canary can be seen in ghidra

Generally canary dosent start with ff or f7 and it generally ends with 00
First run fuzz.py, run it a few times and find a fairly random looking value

in gdb 
# canary 
put breakpoint at printf of vuln function
# break *0x0804921f

then run the program to find at which offset the canary is 
at breakpoit type
#canary

Found valid canaries on the stacks:
00:0000│-16c 0xffffca6c ◂— 0x7f3f2a00
00:0000│-00c 0xffffcbcc ◂— 0x7f3f2a00
00:0000│+014 0xffffcbec ◂— 0x7f3f2a00
00:0000│+074 0xffffcc4c ◂— 0x7f3f2a00

To print 100 elements fro mstack pointer
# x/100x $esp
start from 0 so 23rd element is the canary

   0x08049253 <+121>:	je     0x804925a <vuln+128>
   0x08049255 <+123>:	call   0x8049310 <__stack_chk_fail_local>
   0x0804925a <+128>:	mov    ebx,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4]
je checking if canary is equal to the value set if not it calls stack_chk_fail
